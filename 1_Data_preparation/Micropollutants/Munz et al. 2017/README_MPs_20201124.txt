README - Christian Stamm

As preparation for our zoom meeting, I have checked the micropollutant dat sets we have used in the second macroinvertebrate paper:

-	Tab_Delta_allMacro_v20181116.csv

This file contains the median values for sum TUs for HM, PB, and Other. We have also used the max values for these three groups as well. It is based on tox data from all invertebrates, using the geometric mean. These data correspond to the data provided by Nicole in the file 

-	Spear_median_sumTU_msPAF 

on the switchdrive (switchdrive\EcoImpact_Macro\Output Data\Overview_sumTU_msPAF\spear_median_sumTU_msPAF.csv).

This second file also contains the data specific for insecticides, fungicides, herbicides.
